After I finished my studies I finally had the time to start a blog about my spare time projects. Those projects will be most likely about game **development** and **tooling**. I really hope that I find enough time and motivation to keep a constant content flow. I hope 2020 will be an awesome year full of coding, blogging and gaming.

Thanks to Nielsen Ramon who created this awesome jekyll template. Check out the footer for more details. 

Have a great time!
